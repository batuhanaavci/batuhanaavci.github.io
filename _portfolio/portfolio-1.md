This project was done as part of the course ELEC-E8004 Project Work course at Aalto University. The primary objective of this project was to develop and implement updated lab assignments and pre assignments for the control labs in the ELEC-C1310: Laboratory Exercises in Automation and Control Engineering course at Aalto University. Leveraging the Quanser Qube Servo 2 system, the project aims to provide students with practical, hands-on experience in control. On top of the course content, the scope is extended to non-linear control, and an energy-based swing-up combined with an LQR for balancing has been implemented.


## Video Demonstration

Below is a video demonstrating the implementation of control methods on the Quanser Qube Servo 2:
