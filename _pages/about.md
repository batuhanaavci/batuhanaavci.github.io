I am currently a master's student in Electrical Engineering at Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. I am specializing in control and robotics, with a minor in machine learning. My research interests lie at the intersection of these fields, particularly in optimal control, uncertainty quantification, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic methods.

## Teaching and Research Assistantships

Currently, I am a teaching assistant for *ELEC-E8101 Digital and Optimal Control* at Aalto University under Prof. Dominik Baumann. For the upcoming semester, I will also be a teaching assistant for *CS-E4825 Probabilistic Machine Learning* under Prof. Pekka Marttinen.

My research journey began at the *Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems (AI2S) Laboratory* at Istanbul Technical University, where I focused on uncertainty quantification and its integration into deep learning and fuzzy logic systems.

Last summer, I joined the *Computational Systems Biology* group at Aalto University, led by Prof. Harri Lähdesmäki, as a research assistant. During this time, I worked on continuous-time reinforcement learning methods.
